# Context
Connect UI actions to VS Code commands: open file, refresh/reindex, and (optional)
promote via the Logics flow script.

# Plan
- [ ] 1. Implement "Open" command from selected card.
- [ ] 2. Implement "Refresh" to re-run the indexer and update the UI.
- [ ] 3. Implement "Promote" using the flow manager script with error handling.
- [ ] FINAL: Confirm non-destructive behavior in documentation.

# Validation
- Manual: open, refresh, and promote actions work; errors are surfaced in the UI.

# Report
