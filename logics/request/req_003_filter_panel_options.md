# Needs
- Regroup the existing options into a dedicated panel that opens when clicking a filter-like icon.

# Context
- The toolbar currently exposes options as inline toggles.
- The goal is to declutter the header while keeping quick access to options.

# Clarifications
- Clicking the filter icon opens a panel containing the options.
- The filter icon button sits on the same row as the buttons but is docked to the left side of the panel.
- The panel should contain the current options (e.g., Hide used requests, Hide completed), unless otherwise specified later.
