# Needs
- Add a “+” button in each column header, positioned to the left of the eye toggle, to create new Logics items (Request, Backlog item, or Task).

# Context
- The flow board already has column headers with a visibility (eye) toggle.
- Users want a quick, in-place way to create new items directly from the board UI.

# Clarifications
- The “+” button shows a choice between creating: Request, Backlog item, or Task.
- The “+” icon should be placed to the left of the eye icon in the column header.
- The action should be accessible from any column (same options everywhere), unless later scoped.
- Remove the “New Request” button from the top header once this change is complete.
- Rename the “Open” button in the details actions to “Edit”.

# Backlog
- TBD (create a backlog item when the implementation task is defined).
